     <h1> A Case Study in Managing a <br>Distance Education<br> Consortium</h1>
    <h4>  Vicky A. Seehusen<br>   
Colorado Electronic Community College, USA</h4></div>
          
 <p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This chapter describes the unique distance education consortium called
CCCOnline developed by the Community Colleges of Colorado System (CC
of C). CC of C is comprised of 14 Colorado Community Colleges and delivers
courses, certificates and degrees to more than 250,000 students per year. The
CCCOnline consortium, managed by the Colorado Electronic Community
College (CECC), provides centralized management of faculty and curriculum
and the consortial member colleges provide most of the student services to
their students enrolled in the program.<p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This chapter traces the organizational evolution of CCCOnline.
CCCOnline was very much a “top-down” creation. It was also built very
quickly. The creators of CCCOnline believed that speed was necessary to get
educational offerings online and that internal relationships could be dealt with
later. Neuhauser, Bender, and Stromberg (2000) echo this belief. They state
that adding an e-business to traditional business creates a parallel culture.
Furthermore, they believe that, at present, many consumers seem to accept
that new products will have a few bugs and that the key is to figure out how
to deliver speed and quality over the long run.<p></p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;   At the time CCCOnline was created, there was little information about
designing online distance education consortia. Witherspoon (1996) had
compiled a planner’s casebook that included real world experiences of a.
number of universities and colleges that had created distance education
courses or programs. Dixon (1996) had compiled a guide for students that
includes chapters on quality in distance education and what to expect in a
virtual classroom. Porter (1997) had endeavored to give practical advice on
putting together effective programs and courses, including a checklist for
course design and evaluation. All of these books were useful but only barely
prepared CECC for issues, challenges, problems and confrontations to come. <p> 
         &nbsp;&nbsp; In retrospect, CECC’s lack of knowledge of the potential difficulties
might have been a good thing, because the management team proceeded
              without fear of the difficulties ahead<br><br>CECC staff didn’t plan for every contingency and consequently development was not stalled. The CECC staff plugged along, without complete</p></div><br>
          
<div class="first">
      &nbsp;&nbsp; awareness of the difficulties of trying to merge the instructional and student
services policies of 14 colleges. CECC didn’t even know how to go about
improving its awareness and how to best work with the colleges. Every
activity the CECC management team undertook to educate these colleges
about the workings of the centralized management team and the program
policies and procedures became an activity that educated the management
team. CECC soon recognized that each college, while part of the same system,
still had individual policies and processes that had to be taken into account<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;       Over time, intra and intercollegiate teams and committees have been
created to facilitate governance and management of the program and to
deliver high-quality instructional and student services. These committees and
teams allow all the member colleges to have a voice in guiding program
management and the future direction. The committees and teams strive to be
inclusive and often call upon subject matter experts from other parts of the
college(s) to solve problems or create new online educational approaches.
These teams and committees act as connecting agents back to their college
constituents and improve information flow between the constituents and the
management team.<br><br>
          
          
        <p class="b">A CASE STUDY IN MANAGING A DISTANCE<br>
            EDUCATION CONSORTIUM </p>          
          
  &nbsp;&nbsp; CCCOnline is a unique consortial approach to distance education created
in September 1997 by the Community Colleges of Colorado (hereinafter
referred to as “CC of C”). CC of C oversees 13 NCA-accredited Colorado
community colleges and one nonaccredited community college called Colorado Electronic Community College (CECC). Together, these colleges serve
almost 250,000 Colorado students annually. <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; In the fall of 1997, the CC of C System president convened a meeting of
the 14 community college presidents. He proposed the creation of an online
degree and certificate program that would be developed and delivered
consortially. The colleges would share the development costs equally but
would receive revenue based upon their individual college enrollments. A
contract was negotiated with a for-profit vendor to provide the course
management software and support on its computer servers. The vendor’s
initial $100,000 development charge (not including faculty costs) was divided equally among the colleges.</p>
<p>CECC was selected to provide leadership and management support for
the new online program. Since 1995, CECC had managed an Associate of
Arts telecourse degree program that linked an accredited CC of C college with
an outside vendor. The accredited CC of C college provided the financial aid
and transcripted the credit, and the vendor provided national marketing, a call
center, and bookstore/videotape delivery services. CECC hired faculty,</div><br>
      <div class="first">
   &nbsp;&nbsp;  provided the instructional materials, advising and registration services, and
managed the relationships with the vendor and the accredited CC of C college.
    So CECC was a logical choice to lead the new consortium because of its
previous experience managing college/for-profit partnerships. Also, because
CECC was not accredited and did not enroll students, the member colleges
considered it noncompetitive.<p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; The name chosen for the new online consortial model was CCCOnline.
The first degree CCCOnline offered was an Associate of Applied Science in
Business. Many of CC of C colleges already had their own versions of this
degree, and it was a popular degree. So it was a generally held belief that this
degree would generate high enrollments. Still in the early days of the
development of CCCOnline, two main challenges were identified:<p>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;  1. Creating a degree with a consistent list of course offerings and
requirements on which colleges could mutually agree. All of the
colleges offered all of the courses that would be part of the online
Associate of Applied Science in Business. However, for some colleges the new online degree required giving up one or two courses
from their current business degrees. For other colleges, the new
online degree obligated them to accept new courses that were not
required in their current business degrees.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;2. Creating an equitable financial model. From the beginning, CECC,
managing CCCOnline on behalf of the consortium, was intended to be
mainly self-supporting. The model had to allow for a management fee to
support CECC and create enough new state general fund support and
tuition funds for member colleges.</p>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;The CECC management team put in long, intense days during the first
two months of operation. The management team strived to meet the goals of
the program and simultaneously respond to implementation challenges.
There were two program goals:<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;1. To eliminate redundancy of online offerings.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;2. To expand educational offerings to rural students.<br>
 Many community colleges, especially in the Denver metropolitan area,
were already offering online courses. In the year prior to the creation of
CCCOnline, these colleges became aware that they could no longer control
a service area marked by geographic boundaries. Therefore, these colleges
could not depend on students residing in the college service areas to continue
to fulfill their educational requirements at the local community college.
      Also,
the colleges duplicated other colleges’ online course offerings, and CC of C
believed that this duplication was an inefficient use of the hardware, software,
    personnel, and financial resources of the individual colleges.</div><br>
       <div class="first">
 &nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, students in rural Colorado were faced with a limited
      number of choices when it came to community college courses and programs.
Due to demands and economies of scale, many classes that could be offered
in heavily populated urban areas could not be offered in the rural areas. Also,
it was often difficult in rural areas to find faculty with subject matter expertise
needed to teach certain classes.<p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;   During the start-up days of CCCOnline, CECC remained the focal point
for all communications regarding instructional, administrative, and student
services issues. Communications between CECC staff and college staff were
extensive. Misunderstandings were abundant, and even when policies and
procedures were clarified, it wasn’t always clear who should receive the
clarifications and whether the information would be widely disseminated.
However, the CECC management team remained focused on working with
the college partners to provide high-quality instruction and student services,
and to eliminate barriers to online teaching and learning. Ad hoc teams of
interested individuals were created to deal with immediate and obvious
issues. These teams are defined the next section.
          
          
          <br><p class="b">AD HOC TEAMS</p>
          <p class="e">The College Teams <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Despite resistance from many of the local community colleges and
limited policies and procedures, the first degree was online within 100 days
of the creation of CCCOnline. A number of member colleges provided faculty</p>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;    to develop the initial 20 classes. Colleges that volunteered the initial faculty
did so at their own expense, either paying the faculty overload fees or
providing paid release time. The college presidents agreed that once the first
degree was developed, all the colleges enrolling students in CCCOnline
courses would jointly absorb future course development costs. Even those
colleges where resistance to the consortial model was the highest were
anxious to be contributors for fear that they might be left out of a potentially
successful program.
          New policies and procedures written in early days were designed to
address student services issues. Member college registrars met to discuss
student record processes: 1) how the courses would be entered into their
databases, 2) how to distinguish these courses from other campus offerings,
3) how and when to create semesters and sessions; and, 4) what semester and
session start and stop dates would be.Other ad hoc student services teams were created as required. These
teams met to discuss how to deliver online advising, provide financial aid
services online, and develop a common online application form.
      </div><br>
      <div class="first">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;   While CECCgradually realized that long-term committees and new ways of communicating would have to be established after the program was built, its initial,
primary goal was to get its CCCOnline up and running.
          <br><p class="e">The Course Management Provider Team</p>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;    Using an outside vendor with its own hardware, software, and personnel resources allowed the instructors to focus on the development of highquality course materials. The local vendor, eCollege.com, provided the
course management software and was initially chosen because it could
provide an application and registration software in addition to the course
management software. The existing Student Information System (SIS),
registration software used by the community colleges, did not allow for
online registration. We strove to create a one-stop online site for students,
regardless of the college that would grant the credit. The vendor provided
the online application and registration software. Students could visit the
central website, choose a “home” college from among the consortial
members, apply, and enroll. Once classes began, students could access the
same online site to receive their instruction. For these services, the vendor
charged a onetime, up-front, development fee for each course created on
its system. The vendor also charged a per-student enrollment fee that
would be computed and billed the day after the last date to drop in any<br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;given session (14 days after the course start date).<p>The enrollment data collected by the vendor’s software was uploaded to
the member colleges’ computerized SIS every night. It helped that every
college in the consortium used the same SIS; only one program had to be
          written to update the records of the consortial member colleges</p><br>
          
          <p class="e"> The Centralized Computer Services Team </p>
          
       &nbsp;&nbsp;    CC of C centrally maintains the SIS for the member colleges. Staff from
the CC of C's Computer Department worked very closely with the vendor’s
technical staff. Together, they formed a team that wrote the program that
would upload and download data between CC of C computers and vendor
computers. the CC of C's Computer Department also wrote programs that
would search college SIS databases and remove the duplicate records that
were sure to be created. Duplication was inevitable because all students, even
those currently enrolled in traditional courses at member colleges, were
required to reapply the first time they elected to take CCCOnline courses. This
was necessary so that the vendor could establish a student database and build
course rosters. Additionally, the CC of C's Computer Department met with
the registrars and CECC staff and created procedures to assure that online
courses were included in each college’s database.</div><p>
      <div class="first">    
     &nbsp;&nbsp;  In January 1998, CCCOnline began offering the Associate of Applied
Science in Business degree. The first semester, slightly less than 300 students
enrolled in CCCOnline courses. CECC considered this a great start considering that very little advertising and virtually no up-front marketing had been
done. From the onset, it was clear that there was a market for this type of
educational offering and that the program was destined to grow.<p>
         
           <b></b><p class="b"> A SAMPLING OF PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED<p>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;During CCCOnline’s first two months of online operation, a majority of
the problems related to instructional content. However, towards the last week
of the first semester, a host of issues surfaced. Student services, instructional
services, and business services departments across the consortium began
identifying issues needing resolution. Some of the more gripping issues the
consortium faced are described below<br>
        <p class="e">Student Services Issues<p>  
           &nbsp;&nbsp;During the short time of “program creation to market delivery,” little
thought was given to the way that student services would be handled at theindividual member colleges. Because all of the colleges were part of CC of C,
it was generally believed that all colleges operated with similar student
services procedures. As CCCOnline moved towards the end of the first
semester, there was a gradual realization that individual college student
services departments varied widely in their practices. Among other things, the
colleges did not use common grading policies or common forms.
For example: some colleges did not use an F as a part of their grading
scale; some colleges allowed the student to receive an S for satisfactory
work; and other colleges did not allow an S letter grade. The colleges were
reluctant to change their traditional grading policies. This meant that the
instructor had to read the policies of the home college of each student in
his/her class to determine the appropriate grading policy. The grading
policy, initially posted on CCCOnline, reflected each college’s individual
grading policy and was 37 pages long!<p>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;Also, each college had its own grade change, withdrawal and incomplete forms, so instructors wishing to use one of these forms on behalf of
an individual student had to contact the student’s home college and
request and submit the proper forms. It wasn’t long before faculty began
          to complain loudly.</p></div><br>
           <div class="first"> 
          <p class="i"> Instructional Services Issues<p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;Faculty were dissatisfied with the myriad of forms that they had to use and
some were dissatisfied with the faculty pay plan. When CCCOnline was
created, a separate faculty pay plan was developed. Under this plan, the
colleges who employed the instructors teaching for CCCOnline would
prepare “overload contracts” for those instructors. The colleges would then
request reimbursement from CECC for these contracts. CECC would reimburse each college the same flat rate, hourly amount regardless of how much
the colleges paid their faculty for normal overload contracts. Most colleges
paid their CCCOnline instructors the total amount that would be reimbursed
by CECC; some colleges paid their CCCOnline instructors more than the
reimbursement from CECC and absorbed the additional costs internally; and
a small minority of colleges paid their CCCOnline instructors less than the
reimbursement amount from CECC. Faculty who were being paid less
demanded that they be paid on par with their contemporaries. The colleges
that were paying less stated that they would not compromise existing overload
pay plans and that it would be unfair to pay their CCCOnline faculty higher
overload rates than the traditional overload rates <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;The second concern that surfaced quickly was how to develop new
courses and degrees consortially. Within a couple months of placing theassociate degree online, CECC began investigating the development of other
degrees that would allow students to upgrade their skills for new employment
or career advancement. From the beginning, small groups of faculty at
different colleges complained that they had no input into the original degree
and demanded a more inclusive process for degree development.<br>
          
          <b></b><p class="i">Business Services Issues<p>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;    Almost immediately upon opening the CCCOnline website to enrollments, the business services units of the colleges identified two areas of high
concern. Students complained that they could apply and enroll online but they
could not pay tuition online. All of the colleges accepted credit card payments
in person or over the telephone, but there was no protected, encrypted
software program that allowed students to pay online. System business
services staff, the CC of C's computer services staff, and the vendor’s
technical staff held many meetings to iron out the timeline and the roles each
               unit would play in securing an online payment service for students.</p></div><br>
       <div class="first"> 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;Enrollment reconciliation, however, caused the most angst for the
business officers. After the census date, the vendor would submit an invoice
based upon the number of credit hours the CCCOnline students were enrolled.
Most of the time, the enrollment figures reported by the vendor were higher
than the enrollment figures reported by the individual colleges. Generally, this
reconciliation problem occurred because students would manually drop their
CCCOnline class at the home college and the information did not get
uploaded into the vendor’s database, or the software designed to update the
vendor database failed. Reconciliation took several weeks.
All of the issues served to drive home the need for more and better ways
of communicating with our college partners and soliciting feedback.<br>
          
<h2> <p class="b">COMMITTEES FORMED TO DEAL WITH<br>
    ONGOING ISSUES</h2> 
            &nbsp;&nbsp;As CCCOnline evolved and grew, three major teams or committees were
formed. They are the Community College Coordinators (CCC), the Ready
Response Team (RRT), and the Online Curriculum Committee (OCC). Each
of these committees or teams plays a vital role in the success and future growth
of CCCOnline.
          
          <b></b><p class="e">Community College Coordinators<p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;The Community College Coordinators (CCC) was the first committeecreated. The presidents of each of the member colleges designated a person
to represent them on this committee. Representation includes instructional
and student services administrators, registrars, business officers, instructors,
and campus distance education staff. The CCC meets quarterly. They discuss
the current status of the program and receive information about how the
program is changing or evolving (including new policies and procedures).
When the CCC was first formed, its major role was to identify and discuss
issues that the colleges uncovered in the ongoing maintenance and implementation of CCCOnline. These frank discussions surfaced problems identified
by one college but actually impacting many colleges. These issues were then
           sent to the Educational Services Council for resolution.</p>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;The Educational Services Council is comprised of all the member
college vice-presidents for student services, vice-presidents for instruction, and some CC of C support staff. Approximately 40 people from
around the state attend the monthly Educational Services Council meetings. The size of the Council quickly became a deterrent to quick
resolution of issues. The Council determined that a smaller team was
needed to investigate issues and make recommendations to the full group.
As a result, the Ready Response Team was created.</div><br>
           <div class="first"> 
          <p class="e">Ready Response Team<p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;  Initial membership of the Ready Response Team (RRT) was comprised of ten Educational Service Council members (including vicepresidents of student services and vice-presidents of instruction). Over
time, some of the vice-presidents sent representatives in their place. Some
of these representatives became members of the team, providing different
perspectives and useful suggestions. From its inception, the RRT met
monthly to discuss and study current issues, and recommend new policies
and procedures to deal with these issues. As the issues submitted to the
team broadened, the RRT expanded its membership to include business
services staff and college distance education directors. At present, there
are 14 people on this committee, representing eight urban and rural
member colleges and CC of C office.<p>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;    Participation in the RRT is high and issues or concerns brought to the
RRT are discussed in great detail. Timeliness is key, however, and the goal
is to create a policy/procedure recommendation within two months after
reviewing an issue. Some issues, such as the online grading policy, may take
longer than two months to resolve. However, every issue brought before the
RRT has resulted in policy or procedure recommendation within five months.
          
           <p class="e">Online Curriculum Committee<p>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;    The OCC approves the online program curriculum once Educational
Services has approved development of a degree or certificate. This committee
has a representative from every college in the consortium. The committee also
has one registrar. Once curriculum is approved by the OCC, it can be
developed on the CCCOnline site. The OCC does not have authority to
approve curriculum that will be used in the traditional classroom. However,
any individual college that wishes to use the approved online curriculum in
the traditional classroom may do so.<br>
          
 <p class="b">LESSONS LEARNED<p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;   I can often be heard saying, “you can’t mandate what matters.” CCCOnline
was created by the combined visions of very small group of people. If the
people you need to be successful don’t “buy-in” to your vision, then it will be
difficult, if not impossible to implement. The argument that “everyone else is
doing it” is not likely to make an impression on most of your constituents. AsI worked with the many different constituents and groups in the CC of C,I
realized that, in times of plenty or scarcity, each constituent has very different
motivators for doing something above and beyond the norm.
               </p></div><br>
       <div class="first"> 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;The constituents are also loyal to their individual college missions. A
program that removes local management and control of any facet of providing
education or services to students will be met with dislike, distaste, and
distrust. The following practices would serve a management team well:<p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;1) The team must be continually attentive and take the time to get to know
the constituents, seek out their hidden motivators and make efforts to
integrate these motivators into the program development.<p>
           
 &nbsp;&nbsp;2) The team has to be dependable and follow through on any commitments
to research topics and vendors, develop courses, and provide information requested by constituents.<p>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;3) The team must provide requested services in a timely fashion.<p>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;4) The team must continually move the program forward and simultaneously respect the fact that different constituents will adapt to change
 at different rates.<p>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;5) The team must live service leadership and be genuine when it states, “We
are here to serve you and your colleges. Together, we all win.”<br><br>
          
 <p class="b">CONCLUSION<p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;  A consortium of the size and scope of CCCOnline continues to face
new issues on an almost daily basis. Communications are many and yet
never seem to be enough. Sometimes well-intentioned procedures and
processes are approved and implemented, and then revised within a few
weeks after implementation because new data is received making changes
imperative. Additionally, as the state commission on higher education
changes its policies, CCCOnline is required to change its policies or
procedures to be in compliance.
There is little literature available for personnel involved in the management of an online consortium of the size and scope of CCCOnline. The
consortial clients for CCCOnline are colleges that are endeavoring to respond
to their individual communities by providing learning and training options for
personal and workforce development. Service to local communities is a
primary mission. Growth of the consortium will be stymied if the consortium
cannot show how serving a more global community will enhance services to
the local community. Interacting with members of other colleges will allow
the various staff and faculty to get a wider perspective on issues. They get to
           see beyond their college’s back-door.</p></div><br>
